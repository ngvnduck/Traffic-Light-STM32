# Traffic-Light-STM32
*This is a project for Microprocessor Engineering class (HUST 2023.1 semester)*
<br><br>Simulate the behavior of traffic lights at a intersection with 2 directions South, West and pedestrians lights with time counter on a LCD16x02 display.
- South: red, yellow, green.
- West: red, yellow, green.
- Pedestrians lights: white, red.
- Input: 3 buttons South, Walk, West. When a button is pressed, that means there is traffic at that corresponding direction.

# Purpose
This lab has these major objectives: 
- The understanding and implementing linked data structures.
- Learning how to create a software system.
- The study of real-time synchronization by designing a finite state machine controller.
- Software skills you will learn include advanced indexed addressing, linked data structures, creating fixed-time delays using SysTick timer, interupt handler and debugging real-time systems.
